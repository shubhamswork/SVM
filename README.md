# SVM
The code computes whether a person takes an action on watching an advertisement having given his age and salary.
Support Vector Machines are so important and are widely used everywhere due the reason that it compares the classes with the
help of support vectors which are nothing else but the  least likely members of the classes e.g assume a class having oranges now 
the vectors would be those members which does not seems to be like  an orange or appears to be of different category.
